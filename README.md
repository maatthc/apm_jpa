JPA APM Test APP
================

This is a example app that uses EJB3 and JPA with different implementations (OpenJPA, Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc)
The idea is to measure the overhead of APM Java Agents when using vary JPA implementations and to measure the JPA implementations performances itself.
